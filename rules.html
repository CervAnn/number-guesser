Overview

Build a game where two users can guess a number between 1 and 100, with the ability for the user to add custom ranges for increased difficulty of play

Display the current guess of both players

Display the final results of each match in card UI

each card should display the name of the winner

each card should display both player’s names

each card should show how many guesses it took to guess the correct number

each card should have a delete button that removes the card from the page

EXTENSION: each card should display how long the match took

Game should be fully responsive and usable down to screens/viewport width of 320px

Project should be pushed to Github with a live site on Github Pages

Care and attention to detail should be clearly demonstrated in execution of the comp

Include a README.md in your project that summarizes the project (this does not mean paste this project spec into your README)

--------------------

Zero State:
<!-- Two inputs to set a custom range for the random number to fall within
A button to update the custom range -->
for each player:
<!-- An input field for guessing the number which can only accept numeric values -->
An input field for their name that can accept any alpha-numeric character
One button that submits both players guesses
A button for clearing the input field, which does not reset the random number
One button that resets the game and generates a new random number
The clear button should be disabled if there is nothing to clear.
The reset button should be disabled if there is nothing to reset.
Players Guess State:
Display both player’s most recent guesses
Display results and feedback for each players guess:
If their guess is too high, it should display the error message: “That’s too high”
If their guess is too low, it should display the error message: “That’s too low”
If the guess is correct, it should display the success message: “BOOM!” and create a new card to display results (card details are outlined in Phase Three)
Some things to consider:
Input fields,regardless of their “type” attribute, store their values in strings. You’ll need to use parseInt() to turn it back into a number.
You’ll need a strategy for generating random numbers.
