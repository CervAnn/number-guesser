<h2>Nathan and Ann's Number Guesser Project</h2>

<p>This project was a collaboration between Nathan Froehlich and Ann Cerveny (1903 Front-End Engineering) in an attempt to replicate "Number Guesser". Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, we pieced together an interactive web page that uses JavaScript to engage two players as they attempt to guess the computer-generated random number that resides between the two range values offered. When a user accurately guesses the number, a card appends that displays the name of the winner of the game. This project was completed in their third week at Turing School of Software and Design. We hope you enjoy interacting with it as much as we enjoyed working on it.</p>
